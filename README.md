# Personalized Intervention Effect - Example Visualization

This dashboard is an exampe tool of how we can explore/visualize personlized intervention effect.
Since the effectness of interventions (e.g., health, policy, education) can differ amongst different subgroups, 
practitioners need an easy way to navigate the impact of interventions on the subgroups of interest.

## Methods and Tools


### Description

The data set is based on a fictitious RCT scenario where we have a two groups study design (control and treatment), 
and a number of patient characteristics were recorded.
The individual treatment effects were estimated baesd on the a meta-learner algorithm from [casualml](https://github.com/uber/causalml).
The dashboard was built on [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/).
